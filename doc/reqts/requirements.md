# NOTE

To add diagrams to the document:

1. Save it as an image  
2. Place it in the /doc/reqts folder  
3. Place `![Alt-text](image.jpg)` in the area of the document you want it to appear.  "Alt-text" should be descriptive of what the image is (i.e. "Use-case diagram")

Tips:

* To do a paragraph break, hit 'enter' twice  
* To do a line break, add 2 spaces to the end of the current line, and hit enter
* Eclipse "Preview" mode for markdown seems to have trouble with nested bullets, but if you format it like I have in "Scope", it should work when we create the final document
* Once you get the hang of Markdown, it's pretty simple.  But if you have any questions, Google is your friend.  Also feel free to ask me (Evan) or Chris.
