## Platform
The program is supposed to run on all the operating systems or machines which are able to run .jar files since the programming language used is Java. 

## Scope

The program must have the ability to import robots using the robot language, parser that implements all features of robot language, UI to control the application, choose the robots and show the matches being played and a match execution mode to play through a single match.

The program should have tournament execution mode with 6 teams and give the results of a tournament instantly.

In additions to other requirements, the program can have a testing mode where the tester can step through the program and movements once at a time and see every change in the game and with the robots happening.

# NOTE

To add diagrams to the document:

1. Save it as an image  
2. Place it in the /doc/reqts folder  
3. Place `![Alt-text](image.jpg)` in the area of the document you want it to appear.  "Alt-text" should be descriptive of what the image is (i.e. "Use-case diagram")

Tips:

* To do a paragraph break, hit 'enter' twice  
* To do a line break, add 2 spaces to the end of the current line, and hit enter
* Eclipse "Preview" mode for markdown seems to have trouble with nested bullets, but if you format it like I have in "Scope", it should work when we create the final document
* Once you get the hang of Markdown, it's pretty simple.  But if you have any questions, Google is your friend.  Also feel free to ask me (Evan) or Chris.
