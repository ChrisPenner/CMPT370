# Design## Preliminary DesignNeed:- Data Flows- Large modules/packages- Architectural Design	- The modules, and	- Their interactions	### ArchitectureWe will be utilizing the Model-View-Controller architecture.  Since this architecture splits the project into 3 parts, it will allow us to easily collaborate on code.  Each module will have it's own API, or public interface, allowing someone working on one part of the project to easily interact with another part without worrying about the underlying implementation.  Further, the person working on the one module will be able to make changes without fear of breaking it for the other modules, since they know how the other modules are interacting with it.TODO: Diagram### ModulesThe architecture for this project will be broken into 3 parts, as per the Model-View-Controller architecture:#### 1. Model#### 2. View#### 3. Controller### Data Flows## Detailed DesignNeed:- Data Formats/Table Layouts- Code interfaces (i.e. public class interfaces)	- Method names	- Post-, pre-, and error conditions- Optional pseudocode for complex operations ### Code Interfaces|Robot Object         ||---------------------||*int* teamNumber     ||*int* robotNumber    ||*int* pointsLeft     ||*int* maxMoves       ||*int* movesLeft      ||*int* power          ||*int* health         ||*int* range          ||*bool* hasFired      ||*void*: move(coords) ||*void*: fire(coords) ||*Robot*: scan(coords)||*Stats*: getStats()  ||Match Controller Object            ||-----------------------------------||*Robot* [ ] robots                 ||*Cell* [ ] cells                   ||*int* turnNumber                   ||*int* maxTurns                     ||*int* currentTeam                  ||*int* executionSpeed               ||*void*: stepForward()              ||*void*: stepBack()                 ||*Robot*: getContentsOfCell(coords) ||*void*: damageRobot(robot)         |## Views|Main Menu View                     ||-----------------------------------||*void* loadWatchMatch()            ||*void* loadInstantResults()        ||*void* loadTestBench()             ||Team Select View                   ||-----------------------------------||*Team* [ ] teams                    ||*void* loadTeam(int slot)          ||*void* confirm()                   ||Watch Match View                   ||-----------------------------------||*MatchController* controller       ||*void* step()                      ||*void* play()                      ||*void* stop()                      ||*void* setRate(int rate)           ||*void* updateLog(string log)       ||*void* (string log)                ||Test Bench View (inherits from Watch Match View)||------------------------------------------------||*void* runCommand()                             ||Match Results View                 ||-----------------------------------||*score [ ]* scores                  || *void* returnToMenu               |
